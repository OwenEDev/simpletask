## Running the web app

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Assumptions / Additional

- Despite being a front end role I thought it would be good for you to see my backend approach with searchR, so I have also provided the link to this repo to the recruiter representing me.
- As this was a 2 hour task, there are several things I realise can be done more effeciently, and if I had the time I'd implement a more eye-catching design
- I made the assumption that running on a web / dev server would be okay rather than an installation, since this is a web app designed to run on a server
- Thank you for the opportunity!
